 * here and add its default to `PHFeatureFlagDefaults`, then check it via
 * `usePHFeatureFlag`.
 *
 * These flags are evaluated client-side and intentionally trust the browser:
 * they are appropriate for UI rollouts/experiments where it's fine if a
 * savvy user flips the flag for themselves. Flags that must also gate
 * backend behavior should be evaluated server-side and surfaced via the
