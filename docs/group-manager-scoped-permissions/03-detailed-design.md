# §8 Scoped Permissions (Group Manager) — Detailed Design

Granular spec for implementing §8 on `new-permission-system`. All paths relative to repo root.

---

## 1. Database design

### 1.1 New column: `user__user_group.is_manager`

Reuses the dead `is_curator` slot semantically (we **add** `is_manager` and later drop `is_curator`; we do
**not** rename in-place — the backfill needs both columns to coexist during the transition).

```python
# backend/onyx/db/models.py  — class User__UserGroup (currently lines 4356-4368)
is_manager: Mapped[bool] = mapped_column(
    Boolean, nullable=False, default=False, server_default=text("false")
)
```

| Attribute | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Name | `is_manager` | Distinct from the tombstone `is_curator`; "manager" matches the §8 vocabulary and the new single-resolver meaning. |
| Type | `Boolean` | A manager binding is binary per (user, group) edge. The *abilities* are code-defined, not stored — so no need for a richer type. |
| `nullable=False` | yes | Every membership row has a definite manager-or-not state; avoids tri-state ambiguity in the `WHERE is_manager` filter. |
| `default=False` / `server_default='false'` | yes | New memberships are non-managers; existing rows backfill to `false` before the targeted UPDATE sets the real managers. Server default lets the `ADD COLUMN` be non-blocking. |
| Placement | on the **edge** `user__user_group`, not on `user` or `permission_grant` | Scope is per-(user, group). `permission_grant` stays **global-only** (`group_id NOT NULL`, no `user_id`). A role binding is not a permission. |
| Index | **none new** — reuse `ix_user__user_group_user_id` (models.py:4359) | The live LIST lookup is `WHERE user_id = ? AND is_manager = true`; the existing `(user_id)` index serves it, and a manager has few memberships so the residual `is_manager` filter is cheap. A partial `(user_id) WHERE is_manager` is an optional later optimization, not needed at launch. |

### 1.1b Cached route-gate flag: `user.is_group_manager` (D1 — cache the boolean)

GATE-2 review chose **cache the boolean** so the route gate needs **zero queries**. Rather than reshape the
`effective_permissions` JSONB (`list[str]` — a sentinel would break `Permission(p)` validation in
`get_effective_permissions`), add a dedicated cached boolean on `User`, recomputed alongside the permission
cache. `effective_permissions` therefore stays **global-tokens-only**; the manager flag is a sibling field.

```python
# backend/onyx/db/models.py  — class User
is_group_manager: Mapped[bool] = mapped_column(
    Boolean, nullable=False, default=False, server_default=text("false")
)
```

| Attribute | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| What it caches | "does this user manage **any** group?" (the boolean only) | The route gate (GATE 1) needs only reachability; it's loaded with the user at auth → no query. |
| What it does **not** cache | the managed-group **list** | The list stays live (`scoped_group_ids_subquery`) so filters + GATE 2 never go stale after a rename/move/delete. |
| Recompute trigger | `recompute_user_permissions__no_commit` (extend) **and** `make/revoke_group_manager` | Flag = `EXISTS(is_manager=true for user)`. Membership changes already recompute; manager flips must recompute the affected user too. |
| Staleness window | bounded to a single user, flipped in the same txn as the membership/manager change | Acceptable — the cost the live-list avoids was the *scope set* going stale, which this doesn't touch. |

### 1.2 Migration — additive only (ship with the feature)

`backend/alembic/versions/c71a18ea7d07_add_is_manager_and_is_group_manager.py`
(revision `c71a18ea7d07`, **down_revision `c8e316473aaa`**).
**Tenant schema** (`alembic/versions/`), NOT `alembic_tenants/`.

```python
def upgrade() -> None:
    op.add_column(
        "user__user_group",
        sa.Column(
            "is_manager", sa.Boolean(), nullable=False, server_default=sa.false()
        ),
    )
    op.add_column(
        "user",
        sa.Column(
            "is_group_manager", sa.Boolean(), nullable=False, server_default=sa.false()
        ),
    )
    # Backfill is_manager — NOT a rename. is_curator alone misses GLOBAL_CURATOR (no per-group rows).
    op.execute("""
        UPDATE user__user_group ug SET is_manager = true
        FROM "user" u
        WHERE ug.user_id = u.id AND u.role = 'CURATOR' AND ug.is_curator = true
    """)
    op.execute("""
        UPDATE user__user_group ug SET is_manager = true
        FROM "user" u
        WHERE ug.user_id = u.id AND u.role = 'GLOBAL_CURATOR'
    """)
    # Backfill the cached flag from the rows just set.
    op.execute("""
        UPDATE "user" u SET is_group_manager = true
        WHERE EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM user__user_group ug
            WHERE ug.user_id = u.id AND ug.is_manager = true
        )
    """)


def downgrade() -> None:
    op.drop_column("user", "is_group_manager")
    op.drop_column("user__user_group", "is_manager")
```

- **Ordering invariant:** must run **before** any later migration drops `role` / `is_curator`. Captured in
  `01-research.md` (disappearing-tombstone trap).
- **Fresh installs / new tenants:** backfill UPDATEs match nothing; `is_manager` starts all-false. ✓
- **Migration report (operational, not a migration step):** a one-off script flags any CURATOR/GLOBAL_CURATOR
  whose backfill mapped to **zero** managed groups (snapshot caveat — GLOBAL_CURATOR was dynamic). Out of the
  migration transaction; can be a logged query or admin CSV.

### 1.3 Deferred (NOT in this feature)

Dropping `is_curator`, `role`, `UserRole`; migrating the 3 `user.role==UserRole.ADMIN` readers. Separate cleanup
release — keeps a code rollback possible while §8 is unproven.

---

## 2. Code design — new authorization primitives

**One classifier decides authority everywhere — no `allow_scope` fork, no separate `has_permission_or_scope`.**
`has_permission` itself returns the authority. The classifier + bundle live in the pure `permissions.py`; the
DB-querying scope logic (scope resolution, write gates, read clause) lives in
**`backend/onyx/auth/scoped_permissions.py`** (imports `User`, `User__UserGroup`, the bundle — one direction).

### 2.1 The manager ability bundle (in `permissions.py`)

```python
SCOPED_MANAGER_PERMISSIONS: frozenset[Permission] = frozenset(
    {
        Permission.MANAGE_CONNECTORS,
        Permission.MANAGE_DOCUMENT_SETS,
        Permission.MANAGE_AGENTS,
        Permission.ADD_AGENTS,
        Permission.MANAGE_USER_GROUPS,  # membership + resource sharing of the managed group only
        Permission.MANAGE_SKILLS,  # NEW dedicated token (D5) — also grantable globally in the groups UI
        Permission.MANAGE_ACTIONS,  # tools/MCP — GATE 1 reach + create only (D4); manage is owner-or-admin (D8)
    }
)
```
Code-defined, never written to `permission_grant`, never merged into `effective_permissions` (which stays
global-only). Lives in `permissions.py` (not `scoped_permissions.py`) so `has_permission` can read it to
classify SCOPED authority without an import cycle.

> **`MANAGE_ACTIONS` is in the bundle (D4).** GATE 1 would 403 a scoped manager on every
> action endpoint otherwise. The route gate lets the manager *reach* the tool/MCP endpoints and create their
> own; managing an existing action or server is owner-or-admin — the agent-mediated GATE 2 once planned here
> was built and then dropped (**D8**). See §11.1.

### 2.2 `has_permission` — the single 3-state classifier

A scoped grant is **group-qualified** ("manage:connectors for groups {3,7}") — it has no flat token
representation, so it can never live in `effective_permissions`, and `has_permission` can never answer a plain
`True` for a manager: 7 existing call sites treat `True` as global "do anything" (see-all filters, set
featured/listed/public, fetch-any — call-site audit), so a bool returning `True` for a manager would leak
org-wide powers. So `has_permission` returns **which** authority the user holds:

```python
class PermissionAuthority(Enum):
    GLOBAL  # holds the token outright / admin → unrestricted
    SCOPED  # group manager → only within managed groups
    NONE  # not authorized


def has_permission(user: User, permission: Permission) -> PermissionAuthority:
    if permission in get_effective_permissions(user):  # global token / admin override
        return PermissionAuthority.GLOBAL
    if permission in SCOPED_MANAGER_PERMISSIONS and user.is_group_manager:
        return PermissionAuthority.SCOPED  # cached flag → zero query
    return PermissionAuthority.NONE


def has_global_permission(user: User, permission: Permission) -> bool:
    """GLOBAL-only convenience for the many checks that must exclude scoped managers."""
    return has_permission(user, permission) is PermissionAuthority.GLOBAL
```

Existing callers migrate by a behavior-preserving rule — a `SCOPED` manager reproduces the old `False` at
those sites, so nothing leaks and the feature stays inert until each filter opts into `SCOPED` (§3):

```
has_permission(user, X)        →  has_global_permission(user, X)
not has_permission(user, X)    →  not has_global_permission(user, X)
```

### 2.3 Live scope resolution (in `scoped_permissions.py`)

```python
def scoped_group_ids_subquery(user: User) -> Select:
    """Composable subquery of the user's managed group ids — embed in _add_user_filters
    so the scope predicate stays in SQL (no extra round-trip)."""
    return select(User__UserGroup.user_group_id).where(
        User__UserGroup.user_id == user.id,
        User__UserGroup.is_manager.is_(True),
    )


def get_scoped_groups(
    user: User, db_session: Session, permission: Permission | None = None
) -> set[int]:
    """Imperative form for the write-side gate. Empty if permission given but not scopable."""
    if permission is not None and permission not in SCOPED_MANAGER_PERMISSIONS:
        return set()
    return set(db_session.scalars(scoped_group_ids_subquery(user)).all())
```

### 2.4 GATE 1 — route gate (one classifier, per-endpoint threshold)

`require_permission` keeps the single `has_permission` classifier; `allow_scope` only sets the **acceptance
threshold** — it is NOT a second resolution path, and `has_permission_or_scope` is gone:

```python
# permissions.py — require_permission(required, *, allow_anonymous=False, allow_scope=False)
permitted_by_user = (
    (has_permission(user, required) is GLOBAL)
    if not allow_scope
    else (has_permission(user, required) is not NONE)
)
# pass:  permitted_by_user AND permitted_by_token     (token cap unchanged)
```

- **default (`allow_scope=False`)**: `is GLOBAL` → identical to today; a manager is rejected. The safe default
  for every endpoint whose GATE 2 has not landed.
- **`allow_scope=True`**: `is not NONE` → a manager *reaches* the endpoint. Set this **only when the endpoint's
  GATE 2 exists** (PR3/PR4). This per-endpoint opt-in **is** the lands-together / no-escalation invariant:
  ~101 bundle-token endpoints exist today with no GATE 2, and managers already exist (PR1 backfills
  `is_manager` for ex-curators), so admitting `SCOPED` universally would let an ex-curator create resources in
  arbitrary groups. No DB session at the route (reads the cached flag).

Admin-only endpoints on a **non-bundle** token (`set_group_permissions` → `FULL_ADMIN_PANEL_ACCESS`) classify a
manager as NONE regardless of `allow_scope` → reject automatically.

### 2.5 GATE 2 — per-resource write gates (authorization of record)

Two gates, both built on the one classifier:

```python
def assert_within_scope(
    user: User,
    db_session: Session,
    *,
    permission: Permission,  # the manage:* token this write needs
    current_group_ids: Collection[int],  # re-read from DB, in this txn
    requested_group_ids: Collection[int],  # client-supplied target groups
    is_non_public: bool,  # access_type!=PUBLIC (cc_pair) / not is_public (doc set)
) -> None:
    authority = has_permission(user, permission)
    if authority is PermissionAuthority.GLOBAL:
        return  # base-system rules govern
    if authority is PermissionAuthority.SCOPED:
        managed = get_scoped_groups(user, db_session, permission)
        final = set(current_group_ids) | set(requested_group_ids)
        if managed and final and final.issubset(managed) and is_non_public:
            return
    raise OnyxError(
        OnyxErrorCode.INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS,
        "Group managers can only act on private resources within the groups they manage.",
    )  # NONE, or out-of-scope


def assert_global(
    user: User, *, permission: Permission
) -> None:  # delete / admin-only on a bundle token
    if has_permission(user, permission) is not PermissionAuthority.GLOBAL:
        raise OnyxError(
            OnyxErrorCode.INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS, "Admin only."
        )  # SCOPED manager rejected
```

`assert_within_scope` invariants: `final ⊆ managed` (closes capture-by-reassign), `final` non-empty (stays in
≥1 group — covers detach), `is_non_public` (PRIVATE or SYNC), **fail-closed** (empty `managed` ⇒ reject).
`assert_global` (D6, **rule A**) keeps delete/admin-only ops admin-only even though they share a bundle token
with scoped create/update: the route admits the manager (SCOPED ≠ NONE), the handler's `assert_global` rejects
them.

> **GATE 2 attaches to the group-share / access-change step, not to owner self-edits.** An owner editing their
> own private persona holds `NONE` for `MANAGE_AGENTS` and must still pass — `assert_within_scope` guards the
> `update_persona_access` (group_ids / is_public) write specifically, not every mutation (§11.5).

### 2.6 Manager assignment helpers (EE)

```python
# backend/ee/onyx/db/user_group.py
def make_group_manager(db_session: Session, user_id: UUID, group_id: int) -> None:
    """Flip is_manager=true on the (user, group) row. Row must exist (a manager is a member).
    Idempotent. Used by the migration backfill helper and the assignment UI."""


def revoke_group_manager(db_session: Session, user_id: UUID, group_id: int) -> None:
    """Flip is_manager=false. Idempotent."""
```

### 2.7 Cached-flag recompute (D1 plumbing)

`backend/onyx/db/permissions.py:43` `recompute_user_permissions__no_commit` — **extend** to also set
`user.is_group_manager = EXISTS(is_manager=true for that user)` in the same write. This already fires on
membership add/remove (`update_user_group:570`). Additionally, `make_group_manager` / `revoke_group_manager`
must call `recompute_user_permissions__no_commit([user_id], db_session)` for the affected user so a pure
manager flip (no membership change) refreshes the cached flag. `effective_permissions` content is unchanged (global tokens only).

---

## 3. Filter rewrites — the `_add_user_filters` set

> **Reconciled with §11.4/§11.7** (regression review): the real set is **4 re-keyed filters** (connector,
> document_set, persona, **skill**) + the `token_limit` write-path. Credentials AND **feedback** are
> unchanged (no feedback permission in the bundle). The table below now carries all four, with the two
> no-ops marked — read it row-by-row. Skill is the odd one out: a new admin-list path, not a filter edit.

**The scope clause is OR-ed *into* each existing editable predicate — it does NOT replace the filter.** Each
`_add_user_filters` keeps its full structure; only two things change: (1) the global short-circuit flips to
`has_permission(user, MANAGE_X) is GLOBAL`; (2) inside the **`get_editable=True`** branch, when
`has_permission(user, MANAGE_X) is SCOPED`, OR in `within_managed_scope_clause(...)`.

```python
def _add_user_filters(stmt, user, get_editable=True):
    if has_permission(user, MANAGE_X) is GLOBAL:
        return stmt                                       # global → all
    if not get_editable and has_permission(user, READ_X) is GLOBAL:
        return stmt                                       # global read → all (persona/doc-set)
    ... existing joins ...
    if get_editable:
        where_clause = <existing owner/share/member/creator predicate>   # PRESERVED
        if has_permission(user, MANAGE_X) is SCOPED:                     # NEW, additive
            where_clause |= within_managed_scope_clause(...)
    else:
        where_clause = <existing read predicate>          # PRESERVED — manager reads as a member
    return stmt.where(where_clause)
```

Why additive, not replacement — the regressions this prevents:
- **`get_editable` must be respected.** The read path keeps its own visibility (public/SYNC for cc_pair,
  public+member for doc-set, owner/share/READ for persona); a manager reads there as a normal member. Only the
  editable branch gains the scope term.
- **A `NONE` user keeps their access.** persona owners, cc_pair creators, EDITOR-shares hold no manage token;
  their existing predicate stays. A blanket `NONE → sa_false()` would strip every normal editor.
- **A `SCOPED` manager is also a normal user.** They may own a persona / have created a cc_pair *outside* their
  managed groups; OR-ing (not replacing) preserves that on top of the scoped-editable set.

The editable read-side predicate mirrors GATE 2: editable-by-manager iff every group is managed, in ≥1 group,
and private — exactly `within_managed_scope_clause` (new helper in `scoped_permissions.py`):

```python
def within_managed_scope_clause(
    resource_id_col, junction_resource_col, junction_group_col,
    non_public_clause: ColumnElement[bool],  # a predicate, NOT a bool column — cc_pair passes
    managed_subq: Select,                    #   access_type != AccessType.PUBLIC; doc-set/persona is_public.is_(False)
) -> ColumnElement[bool]:
    # NOT EXISTS(group not in managed)  AND  EXISTS(group in managed)  AND  non_public_clause
```

| File | Existing editable fallback | Integration |
|---|---|---|
| `backend/onyx/db/document_set.py:41` | `sa_false()` (no owner/share concept) | `|=` scope clause over `DocumentSet__UserGroup` (`is_public.is_(False)`). The one resource where a standalone scope filter *happens* to match (`false() OR clause == clause`); still expressed as `|=` for uniformity. |
| `backend/onyx/db/connector_credential_pair.py:50` | member-of-owning-group (all groups ⊆ mine) ∨ creator | `|=` scope clause over `UserGroup__ConnectorCredentialPair` (`access_type == PRIVATE`). |
| `backend/onyx/db/persona.py:77` | owner ∨ owning-group member ∨ EDITOR direct/group share ∨ org-edit | `|=` scope clause over `Persona__UserGroup` (`is_public.is_(False)`); `add:agents` ownership tier unchanged. |
| `backend/onyx/db/skill.py:260` (`list_skills_for_admin`) | none — unfiltered `select(Skill)` | **NEW scoped admin-list path**, not an `_add_user_filters` edit: scope clause over `Skill__UserGroup` (`is_public.is_(False)`), fail-closed, taken only when the caller is `SCOPED`. **Do NOT touch `_add_user_visibility_filter` (`skill.py:85`)** — it has no editable/viewing split and feeds the agent RUNTIME injection path. (§11.2) |
| `backend/onyx/db/feedback.py:46` | admin-only (`FULL_ADMIN_PANEL_ACCESS`) | **NO CHANGE** — not in the bundle. (§11.7) |
| `backend/onyx/db/credentials.py:41` | owner-keyed (`Credential.user_id==user.id`) | **NO CHANGE** — credentials stay owner-scoped; document the deliberate no-op. |
| `backend/ee/onyx/db/token_limit.py` | no `_add_user_filters`; direct group query | enforce managed-scope in the group-token-limit **write/endpoint** path. Minor. |

**Fail-closed:** `scoped_group_ids_subquery` yields no rows for a non-manager, so `within_managed_scope_clause`
contributes nothing — never an unfiltered statement.

---

## 4. Write-path gate insertions (where GATE 2 is called)

> **Superseded by §11.4** (regression review): the table below under-enumerates the manager-reachable
> writes. §11.4 is the complete list (cc_pair status/name/property/prune, persona `/share`, group rename,
> `/agents` attach, skills) with the **delete = admin-only (D6)** rule and the persona-gate fix (§11.5)
> and cc_pair-reattach fix (§11.6). Use §11.4 as the source of truth.

Each DB-write fn loads the resource's **current** groups in-txn, then calls
`assert_within_scope(...)` before mutating (delete/admin-only ops call `assert_global(...)` instead — rule A).
Endpoints switch to `allow_scope=True`.

| Resource / action | DB fn (insert gate here) | Endpoint → new dep |
|---|---|---|
| Connector create | `add_credential_to_connector` (`connector_credential_pair.py:496`, groups via `_relate_groups_to_cc_pair__no_commit:480`) | `connector.py:1603` POST → `require_permission(MANAGE_CONNECTORS, allow_scope=True)` |
| Connector update (groups/access) | cc_pair update path (`server/documents/cc_pair.py` group/access setter) | same dep |
| Document set create | `insert_document_set` (`document_set.py:220`) | `document_set/api.py:33` POST → `MANAGE_DOCUMENT_SETS, allow_scope=True` |
| Document set update | `update_document_set` (`document_set.py:296`) | `document_set/api.py:59` PATCH → same |
| Persona create/update | `create_update_persona` (`persona.py:325`) → `update_persona_access` (`ee/persona.py:68`, `group_ids`+is_public) | persona create/update endpoint → `MANAGE_AGENTS, allow_scope=True` |
| Group create | `insert_user_group` (`ee/user_group.py:413`) | `user_group/api.py:144` POST → **UNCHANGED** `MANAGE_USER_GROUPS` (no `allow_scope`). **D2: admins only create top-level groups** — no self-grant path. |
| Group update / members | `update_user_group` (`ee/user_group.py:504`), `add_users_to_user_group` (`:462`) | `user_group/api.py:194` PATCH, `:215` add-users → `MANAGE_USER_GROUPS, allow_scope=True`; gate: `group_id ∈ managed` |
| Group **permissions** | `set_group_permission(s)__no_commit` (`ee/user_group.py:705/748`) | `user_group/api.py:115` PUT → **UNCHANGED** `FULL_ADMIN_PANEL_ACCESS` (managers cannot grant tokens) |

For group membership/update, GATE 2 degenerates to "is the *target group* in `managed`?" (the resource *is* the
group). For resource writes it is the full `current ∪ requested ⊆ managed` + private check.

**Bulk/list endpoints:** any endpoint accepting multiple resource ids must run GATE 2 **per item**, not on the
first/aggregate (e.g. batch cc_pair group edits).

> **D2 (decided): managers cannot create top-level groups.** Only admins create groups; managers manage the
> groups assigned to them. Group *create* keeps the plain global `MANAGE_USER_GROUPS` dependency (no
> `allow_scope`); `allow_scope=True` applies only to group *update / members*. No manager-creates-manager
> self-grant path to reason about.

---

## 5. PAT composition (§8.5) — minimal change

PAT scopes already cap permissions (`request.state.token_scopes` → `require_permission`, `permissions.py:278`;
model `db/pat.py`). A manager's **group** scope is never encoded in the token — it always comes from live
`is_manager`. Therefore:
- Permissions: effective = (manager bundle ∩ token_scopes) — the existing token cap already does the
  intersection; no change needed.
- Groups: GATE 2 runs regardless of PAT and bounds to live managed groups — a token cannot widen it.

**No PAT schema change.** Add only tests proving a scoped PAT cannot widen group reach.

---

## 6. API surface changes

- **`GET /users/me/permissions`** (`permissions.py` API) — add `is_manager: bool` (true if the user manages any
  group) so the frontend can reveal manager-relevant nav. Optionally `managed_group_ids: list[int]`. Keeps the
  endpoint the single "what can I do?" source.
- **New EE endpoint** — `PUT /manage/admin/user-group/{group_id}/manager` `{user_id, is_manager}` →
  `make_group_manager`/`revoke_group_manager`. Dep: `require_permission(MANAGE_USER_GROUPS, allow_scope=True)`.
  **D3 (decided): admin or manager-of-that-group may assign** — GATE 2 on this endpoint = admin **or**
  `group_id ∈ get_scoped_groups(actor)`. A manager can thus delegate management within their own group;
  assignment of a manager outside the actor's managed groups is rejected. The target `user_id` must already be a
  member of `group_id` (a manager is always a member) — else 400.

---

## 7. Frontend

- `web/src/lib/.../usePermissions` (and `hasPermission`) — consume the new `is_manager` flag; treat a manager as
  holding the scoped `manage:*` tokens **for nav/visibility only** (real enforcement is backend GATE 2).
- Sidebar (`Connectors`/`Document Sets`/`Groups`) shows for managers.
- **Group detail page** — per-member "Make Manager" / "Revoke Manager" toggle (mirrors the old "Make Curator"
  affordance), calling the new endpoint. Files under `web/src/app/ee/admin/groups/[groupId]/`.
- The resource list pages (connectors / doc-sets / agents / skills) call backend list endpoints whose
  filters now return the manager-scoped set — no client-side scoping logic needed (and must not be relied on
  for security). **Exception: the GROUP list is NOT auto-scoped** — `fetch_user_groups` returns all groups
  and needs a manager-scoped variant (§11.9) before the Groups page / assign-toggle UI work for managers.

---

## 8. New files & file tree

```
backend/
  onyx/

## 9. Pre-implementation notes (must honor)

1. **GATE 2 is the authorization of record.** Route gate (`allow_scope`) only widens *reachability*; never let
   it authorize. Every scoped write path must call `assert_within_scope` (or `assert_global` for admin-only ops).
2. **Re-read current groups in-txn.** Never trust the client's group list alone (capture-by-reassign).
3. **Non-PUBLIC only.** Reject any manager create/edit that sets/keeps PUBLIC; PRIVATE and SYNC are in scope
   (a manager manages their group's private *and* auto-sync connectors). Doc sets have no SYNC → PRIVATE only.
4. **Fail closed.** Empty managed set ⇒ no access; guard every filter against an unfiltered fallback.
5. **`set_group_permissions` stays admin-only.** Managers manage membership + resource sharing, never the
   group's token grants.
6. **Bulk endpoints check every item.**
7. **Keep the bundle out of `effective_permissions.global`.** Never persist scoped tokens; resolve live.
8. **Migration before drops.** Backfill `is_manager` before any later release drops `role`/`is_curator`.
9. **Credentials unchanged.** Owner-scoped; deliberately no manager inheritance.
10. **Tracing / OnyxError / typing conventions** per CLAUDE.md (raise `OnyxError`, strict typing, no
    `response_model`).
11. **Extend the existing permission tests; don't reflexively add new test files.** The new permission
    system already has good coverage — verify the relevant suite is sound and add to it when the behavior is
    one it already drives. New files only for genuinely new homes (e.g. migration backfill). See
    [04 Tests](04-implementation-plan.md#tests) for the known homes + the PR1 worked example.

## 10. Decisions resolved at GATE 2

- **D1 → cache the boolean.** New cached `user.is_group_manager` (sibling to `effective_permissions`, not inside
  it), recomputed on membership change and on manager flip; route gate reads it with zero queries. The managed
  **list** stays live. (§1.1b, §2.3, §2.6.)
- **D2 → admins only create groups.** Group create keeps global `MANAGE_USER_GROUPS`; `allow_scope` only on
  group update/members. (§4 table, note.)
- **D3 → admin or manager-of-that-group assigns managers.** Manager-assign endpoint gates on
  `admin ∨ group_id ∈ managed`. (§6.)

## 11. Regression-review resolutions — full case coverage (verified 2026-06-29)

A 5-dimension adversarial review against `new-permission-system` (PAT · admin-retrieval · chat ·
junction-only · completeness, 18 agents) confirmed the core design is sound — PAT cap preserved, chat
runtime untouched, purely junction-based, and the feared backfill data-loss does **not** occur — but found
that §1–10 under-specify several manager-reachable paths. **This section is the authoritative coverage
checklist; implement every row.** New decisions locked with the owner: **D4 actions = `manage:actions` in the
bundle** (its agent-mediated GATE 2 later dropped — **D8**) · **D5 skills = in scope (7th resource)** ·
**D6 managers may do everything EXCEPT delete** (narrowed by **D9**: a creator may delete what they made).

### 11.0 PREREQUISITE — independent boot bug (fix before/with PR1)
`current_curator_or_admin_user` was removed from `onyx/auth/users.py` by §1–7 but is still imported by
`server/features/skill/api.py:16` and `server/documents/targeted_reindex.py:22` → `import onyx.main` raises
`ImportError` and **the API server cannot boot on this branch** (verified at runtime). Re-point both off the
dead dep: skills → see §11.2; `targeted_reindex.py:80/163` → `require_permission(MANAGE_CONNECTORS)` (matches
its connector/indexing peers). This is a merge-integration break, not a §8 feature change, but it blocks
everything. Add an `import onyx.main` smoke test to CI so a deleted auth dep fails fast.

### 11.1 Actions (D4 — `MANAGE_ACTIONS` in the bundle; manage is owner-or-admin per D8)
> **⚠️ SUPERSEDED by D8 (2026-08-03) for the _management_ verbs.** The agent-mediated GATE 2 below
> (edit/toggle/OAuth-auth resolving an action's groups through its referencing agents) was **built, then
> dropped** — it caused most of the review's P1/P2 findings. Manage is now plain **owner-or-admin**
> (`can_manage_own_tool` / `_ensure_mcp_server_owner_or_admin`), mirrored 1:1 by the UI projection; the
> *view* path keeps agent-mediated scope. GATE 1 reach + create (allow_scope=True) is unchanged; **delete
> now follows the same owner-or-admin gate (D9), not admin-only.** Read the rest of this section as
> historical design, not the current gate.

- **`MANAGE_ACTIONS` stays in `SCOPED_MANAGER_PERMISSIONS`** (§2.1). Bundle membership is what GATE 1
  (`has_permission` → SCOPED, admitted when `allow_scope=True`) checks — drop it and a scoped manager 403s at
  the route on every action endpoint. "Agent-mediated" is GATE 2's scope resolution, not a reason to omit it.
- **Reaching the endpoints (GATE 1):** switch the standalone tool/MCP admin endpoints (`tool/api.py`
  POST/PUT/DELETE, `mcp/api.py`) to `require_permission(MANAGE_ACTIONS, allow_scope=True)` so managers can reach
  them, including DELETE — a creator may delete what they made (D9).
- **Scope check (GATE 2):** actions have no direct group; derive an action's groups from the agents that
  reference it — `Tool → Persona__Tool → Persona__UserGroup` — and require them ⊆ managed (+ PRIVATE). This
  **replaces** the current owner-or-admin per-resource check (`_get_editable_custom_tool` /
  `_ensure_mcp_server_owner_or_admin`); keep owner/admin as a bypass.
- **Edge cases:** a tool used by agents spanning a group the manager doesn't manage → reject; a tool referenced
  by **no** agent → no group context → owner/admin only.
- Attaching existing catalog tools to an agent still flows through the persona path (`tool_ids` on
  `create_update_persona`, gated by `MANAGE_AGENTS` + the persona GATE 2) — unchanged.

### 11.2 Skills (D5 — in scope, 7th scoped resource) — REVISED per the GO/NO-GO review
Skills (`Skill__UserGroup` `models.py:4460`; `db/skill.py`) are group-shareable but **do NOT mirror personas
structurally** — the original "re-key the editable filter like personas" instruction was wrong. Five
corrections (verified 2026-06-29):
- **Dedicated `MANAGE_SKILLS` permission (owner decision — replaces the "reuse MANAGE_AGENTS" idea).** Add
  `Permission.MANAGE_SKILLS = "manage:skills"` to the enum + the permission **registry** (so it shows in the
  **groups permission UI** and is grantable to a group globally, like the other manage tokens) and to
  `SCOPED_MANAGER_PERMISSIONS` (so managers get it scoped). **No DB migration needed** —
  `permission_grant.permission` is `Enum(native_enum=False)` (stored as a string), so a new enum value is a
  pure code change. Admins get it automatically via the `FULL_ADMIN_PANEL_ACCESS` override. Don't put it in
  `NON_TOGGLEABLE_PERMISSIONS`. This removes the over/under-grant of reusing `MANAGE_AGENTS`.
- **Do NOT touch `_add_user_visibility_filter` (`skill.py:85`).** It has no editable/viewing split AND it feeds
  the agent RUNTIME — `list_skills_for_sandbox_injection` (`skill.py:250`) → `skills/push.py` → build-session
  sandbox hydration (`session/manager.py:386`, `session/api.py:438`). OR-ing a manager branch into it would
  widen which skills get injected into a manager's agent context at runtime — the exact leak the design
  deliberately closes (admins get NO bypass here on purpose, `skill.py:91-94`). **The manager predicate must
  NEVER enter this filter or any function reaching `push.py`/`session/*`.**
- **Read side = a NEW scoped ADMIN-LIST path.** `list_skills_for_admin` (`skill.py:260`) is `select(Skill)`
  with no filter — a re-pointed manager would see every skill in the tenant. Add a manager-scoped variant
  (`within_managed_scope_clause` over `Skill__UserGroup`, PRIVATE-only, fail-closed) used only when the caller
  is a non-admin scoped manager; leave the runtime/visibility filter byte-identical.
- **Write side = GATE 2 on the GRANTS seam, not create/update.** `create_skill__no_commit` takes no group_ids
  and `patch_skill` only toggles is_public/enabled; the only group↔skill writer is `replace_skill_grants`
  (`skill.py:430`, reached via PUT `/admin/skills/custom/{id}/grants`, body `GrantsReplace.group_ids`). Put
  GATE 2 there (current grants via `get_group_ids_for_skill` ∪ requested ⊆ managed, `is_non_public = not
  skill.is_public`, re-read in-txn). Also gate the `is_public` toggle in `patch_custom_skill` so a manager
  can't publish a private skill out of scope.
- **Endpoint re-point BY VERB.** list/get/create/update/share → `require_permission(MANAGE_SKILLS,
  allow_scope=True)`; **skill DELETE stays admin-only (D6).** NOTE: the admin skill router this assumed is
  gone — `31d5a492e4` unified the skill API onto `user_router` + `SkillManagementPolicy`, so the only delete
  is `delete_current_user_skill` (`skill/api.py:937`, `BASIC_ACCESS` + `SkillManagementPolicy.EDIT`). There is
  no admin route left to exclude from the re-point, so D6 has to be enforced inside that handler/policy
  instead. `Skill.is_public` + `Skill__UserGroup` exist, so GATE 2 is expressible. (PR0 parks the
  re-point on `FULL_ADMIN_PANEL_ACCESS` to unbreak boot; PR4 adds `MANAGE_SKILLS` + `allow_scope` + the GATE 2
  and admin-list together, then narrows the deps.)

### 11.3 Manager power = everything EXCEPT deleting a managed-group resource (D6, narrowed by D9)
Managers may create / edit / attach / detach / pause / rename / share within managed groups (non-PUBLIC only —
PRIVATE or SYNC; GATE 2). **Delete is admin-only for a resource that merely sits in a managed group.** These
stay on the plain global dep (no `allow_scope`): connector/cc_pair delete (`administrative.py:141`),
document-set delete (`document_set/api.py:93`), skill delete (`skill/api.py:937` — see §11.2: no admin route
remains, so this one is enforced in the handler, not by a global dep); plus group create
(D2) + group delete + `set_group_permissions` (admin-only).

**D9 carve-out:** deleting something the manager *created* is ownership, not scope, so it follows the same
owner-or-admin gate as every other owner: custom actions / MCP servers (`can_manage_own_tool`,
`_ensure_mcp_server_owner_or_admin`), personas (`can_delete_persona`), personal skills
(`_ensure_owned_personal`). Being a manager never subtracts a right an ordinary user holds.

### 11.4 Complete write-path enumeration (supersedes/extends the §4 table — gate EVERY row)
All `allow_scope=True` + GATE 2 EXCEPT where marked admin-only (D6/D2):

| Endpoint(s) | DB fn (GATE 2 site) | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| cc_pair status `cc_pair.py:427` · name `:512` · property `:542` · prune `:604` | re-keyed editable read-filter authorizes (no group/access change) | allow_scope=True |
| associate-credential `cc_pair.py:716` · connector create mock-cred `connector.py:1568` · bare create `:1538` | `add_credential_to_connector` (`:496`) | allow_scope=True on **all**; the `connector.py:1603` anchor was imprecise (it's the mock-cred path) |
| ee `sync_cc_pair_groups` (sync-groups) · `sync_cc_pair` (sync-permissions) | re-keyed editable read-filter authorizes — NOTE: these only *enqueue* an external sync task (they do NOT rewrite the group junction; that's PR5's `update_user_group`) | allow_scope=True; load `get_editable=True` (they target SYNC connectors, which a manager manages) |
| connector/cc_pair **DELETE** `administrative.py:141` | — | **admin-only (D6)** |
| doc-set create `document_set/api.py:36` · patch `:62` | `insert/update_document_set` (`:220/:296`) | allow_scope=True |
| doc-set **DELETE** `:93` | — | **admin-only (D6)** |
| persona create `persona/api.py:310` · update `:181` · **share `:443`** | `update_persona_access` (§11.5) | allow_scope=True; **GATE 2 keyed on `MANAGE_AGENTS` (D7)** — admin/global bypass; scoped managers ⊆ managed; ADD_AGENTS-only can't group-share |
| skill create/update `skill/api.py:186/...` | skill write fn (§11.2) | allow_scope=True; GATE 2 on `replace_skill_grants` |
| tool/MCP create/update/**delete** `tool/api.py` · `mcp/api.py` | owner-or-admin per resource (`can_manage_own_tool` / `_ensure_mcp_server_owner_or_admin`) — the agent-mediated GATE 2 was dropped (**D8**) | allow_scope=True on every verb; **delete included (D9)** |
| group update/members `user_group/api.py:194/215` · **rename `:164`** | `update_user_group` / `add_users_to_user_group` | allow_scope=True; GATE 2 = group ∈ managed; **cc_pair_ids per §11.6** |
| group `/agents` persona attach `user_group/api.py:256` | `update_persona_access` | allow_scope=True; **manager-scope GATE 2 = target group ∈ managed** (the roster surface) |
| group create `:144` · delete · permissions `:115` | — | **admin-only (D2)** |

### 11.5 Persona group-share = MANAGE_AGENTS-controlled (D7, owner decision 2026-06-29) + gate plumbing
**D7 — who may attach an agent to a group:** self member-share (sharing your own agent to a group) is
controlled by **`MANAGE_AGENTS`** — not `ADD_AGENTS`, not bare membership. So the group-share write is the
**standard GATE 2 keyed on `MANAGE_AGENTS`**, no special carve-out (the earlier membership framing is dropped):
- `has_permission(user, MANAGE_AGENTS)` (admin or a **global** `MANAGE_AGENTS` holder) → bypass; keeps today's
  self-share to their groups.
- else a **scoped manager** → allow only if target groups ⊆ `get_scoped_groups(user, MANAGE_AGENTS)` (managed),
  private. Managers hold `MANAGE_AGENTS` via the bundle.
- else (`ADD_AGENTS`-only) → reject the group-share. Such a user can still create/edit a private, **no-group**
  personal agent — they just can't attach it to a group.

**The gate authorizes the *diff*, not the state.** Unchanged group shares are not a group-share mutation,
so they're exempt for a non-SCOPED actor (the editor round-trips the current groups on every save — without
this a plain owner couldn't edit an agent someone else group-shared) and for an **owner**, who sets their
own agent's privacy per **D9**. "Unchanged" compares the whole `{group_id: permission}` map — re-leveling
a group from VIEWER to EDITOR is a change and gets no exemption. A scoped manager who isn't the owner is
still checked even when nothing changed: holding the share while flipping a public agent private is a
capture. So is the reverse — sharing a public agent *into* a managed group — which no ownership exempts.

> **Current-code nuance to enforce (PR4):** today the persona create/`/share` route gates on `ADD_AGENTS`
> (`persona/api.py:310/340/447`) and the share write authorizes via the **editable fetch** (owner/EDITOR/admin,
> `update_persona_shared:434`), **not** `MANAGE_AGENTS` — so group-share isn't `MANAGE_AGENTS`-gated yet. PR4
> adds the `MANAGE_AGENTS` requirement on the group-share write via GATE 2 (`permission=MANAGE_AGENTS`). The
> route stays `ADD_AGENTS` (so users can still make personal agents) + `allow_scope=True` so scoped managers
> reach it. This is a small, intended tightening of who can put an agent into a group.

Plumbing (review-F2/F4/BR-3): thread the acting `user: User` into `update_persona_access` from all callers
(`create_update_persona` `persona.py:384`, `update_persona_shared` `persona.py:472`, `update_group_agents`
`user_group/api.py:269/281`); apply to BOTH `onyx/db/persona.py:273` (MIT) and `ee/onyx/db/persona.py:68` (EE);
re-read current groups + `is_public` in-txn (don't trust caller flags). `is_public` stays owner/admin-gated
(unchanged — `update_persona_shared`'s `is_owner_or_admin`). The group `/agents` roster surface uses the same
manager-scope GATE 2 (target group ∈ managed) — §11.4.

### 11.6 Group-update cc_pair re-attach is an escalation vector (closes review-F4)
`update_user_group` (`ee/user_group.py:551-562`) rewrites the group↔cc_pair junction from a client
`cc_pair_ids` list, bypassing the gated `add_credential_to_connector`. "group ∈ managed" does **not**
validate those cc_pairs → a manager could attach a public/out-of-scope connector to their group.
**Resolution:** when a scoped manager edits a managed group, run GATE 2 **per added cc_pair** (each within
managed scope + PRIVATE); reject otherwise. Admins unaffected (global bypass).

### 11.7 Filter & recompute corrections
- **Feedback `db/feedback.py:46` → NO CHANGE.** No feedback permission exists in the bundle and its editable
  gate is `FULL_ADMIN_PANEL_ACCESS` (admin-only). Leave it like `credentials.py`; the §3 "mirror connector"
  label was wrong. Real re-keyed filters are **4** (connector, document_set, persona, **skill**) + the
  `token_limit` write-path; credentials + feedback unchanged. ("6 filters" was a miscount.)
- **`recompute_user_permissions__no_commit` (`db/permissions.py:43`) signature is `(user_ids, db_session)`** —
  the §2.6 one-arg call is wrong. Extend the fn to also set `user.is_group_manager = EXISTS(is_manager)` in
  the same txn; `make/revoke_group_manager` call it as `([user_id], db_session)`.

### 11.8 Confirmed SAFE — no action (the three core worries)
- **PAT:** token cap (`permissions.py:278`) preserved verbatim; `allow_scope` only swaps the user-side
  conjunct and only on opt-in routes; GATE 2 never reads the token → a scoped PAT can only narrow, never
  widen group reach. Default `allow_scope=False` path is byte-identical to today. Implementation invariants:
  keep `dependency._is_require_permission = True` unconditional (`permissions.py:288`); keep the default
  path calling `has_permission` directly.
- **Chat:** answer hot path reads `chat_session.persona` (ORM, `process_message.py:635`); all runtime reads
  use `get_editable=False`; GATE 2 never on the send path; `get_acl_for_user` untouched. Invariant: keep all
  filter edits inside the `if get_editable:` block as correlated subqueries — do not perturb the shared joins
  above the split.
- **Junction-only:** scope is purely `User__UserGroup.is_manager` + resource↔group junctions;
  `permission_grant` stays global-only; Vespa ACL untouched. Backfill is safe — no upgrade migration nulls
  `role`, and `native_enum=False` stores `'CURATOR'`/`'GLOBAL_CURATOR'` literally. Ship the
  zero-managed-group migration report for the GLOBAL_CURATOR snapshot caveat.

### 11.9 Group LIST must be scoped (closes the group-list gap)
`fetch_user_groups` (`ee/user_group.py:188`) returns ALL groups with no user/`is_manager` filter, and
`list_user_groups` (`user_group/api.py:46`) is the list the Groups admin page AND the §6 manager-assign
toggle UI depend on. So the §7 claim "list pages already return the manager-scoped set" is **false for
groups** — `MANAGE_USER_GROUPS` is in the bundle but the group list is not one of the re-keyed filters.
Resolution: add a manager-scoped group-list variant filtered by `User__UserGroup.is_manager` (NOT membership),
switch `list_user_groups` (and the single-group/member-list reads the toggle UI needs) to `allow_scope=True`
returning only managed groups for a scoped manager; admins keep the full list. Without this a scoped manager
either 403s on the Groups page (feature unusable) or sees every org group (leak). Correct the §7 wording.

### 11.10 Doc-consistency reconciliations (mechanical)
- **§8 file tree + PR4 file table:** flip `db/feedback.py` to no-op; ADD `db/skill.py` (filter + grants GATE 2)
  and `server/features/skill/api.py` (re-point); ADD `User.is_group_manager` to the models.py line and
  `db/permissions.py` (recompute) — these are the artifacts implementers slice from.
- **§11.0 tokens:** `targeted_reindex.py:80/163` → `require_permission(MANAGE_CONNECTORS)` (matches connector
  peers; independent of the skills token). Skills token per §11.2.
- **D6 delete invariant:** a managed-group resource stays undeletable **only** because its route gate keeps
  `allow_scope=False` — the re-keyed editable filter would otherwise authorize a manager. Never add
  `allow_scope=True` to a DELETE route whose only authorization is that filter (connector/cc_pair, doc set,
  admin skill); add an escalation test asserting each 403s a scoped-only manager. Routes with a per-resource
  ownership gate are the D9 exception: action/MCP/persona delete run `allow_scope=True` and authorize on
  owner-or-admin instead, so the filter never decides.
- Stale prose to fix: "6 filters" → 4 re-keyed + skill (`00:14`, `01:52/64`, `02` ASCII); `§2.6` call →
  `([user_id], db_session)`; `§3` feedback row → NO CHANGE.
