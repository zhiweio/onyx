# Quick Start: Tenant Cleanup Without Bastion

## TL;DR - The Commands You Need

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd onyx/backend

# Step 1: Generate CSV of tenants to clean (5-10 min)
# Cutoff defaults to 60 days of no chat and no Craft activity; --inactive-days changes it.
PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/tenant_cleanup/no_bastion_analyze_tenants.py \
  --data-plane-context <data_plane_context> \
  --control-plane-context <control_plane_context>

# Step 2: Mark connectors for deletion (1-2 min)
PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/tenant_cleanup/no_bastion_mark_connectors.py \
  --csv gated_tenants_inactive_<N>d_*.csv \
  --data-plane-context <data_plane_context> \
  --control-plane-context <control_plane_context> \
  --force \
  --concurrency 8

# ⏰ WAIT 6+ hours for background deletion to complete

# Step 3: Final cleanup (1-2 min)
PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/tenant_cleanup/no_bastion_cleanup_tenants.py \
  --csv gated_tenants_inactive_<N>d_*.csv \
  --inactive-days <N> \
  --data-plane-context <data_plane_context> \
  --control-plane-context <control_plane_context> \
  --force
```

## How It Connects

Every query runs from a pod through `kubectl exec`. There is no bastion host any more, so the
scripts that tunnelled through one have been removed.

**No environment variables needed.** The pods already hold their own database credentials.

## What You Need

✅ `kubectl` access to your cluster
✅ Running `celery-worker-user-file-processing` pods
✅ Permission to exec into pods

❌ No bastion host required
❌ No SSH keys required
❌ No environment variables required

## Test Your Setup

```bash
# Check if you can find worker pods
kubectl get po | grep celery-worker-user-file-processing | grep Running

# If you see pods, you're ready to go!
```

## Important Notes

1. **Step 2 triggers background deletion** - the actual document deletion happens asynchronously via Celery workers
2. **You MUST wait** between Step 2 and Step 3 for deletion to complete (can take 6+ hours).
   Tenants with no documents drain within minutes, since there is nothing to delete.
3. **Monitor deletion progress** with: `kubectl logs -f <celery-worker-pod>`
4. **All scripts verify tenant status** - they'll refuse to process active (non-GATED_ACCESS) tenants
5. **Pods are resolved once per run.** If that pod restarts mid-run, every remaining tenant fails.
   Prefer batches of ~1000 over one enormous run.
6. **Set the namespace on your kubectl contexts.** Pod discovery runs `kubectl get po` with no
   `-n`, so it only sees the context's default namespace.
7. **Verify against the database afterwards, not against the summary.** A tenant counted as
   successful can still leave rows behind if a later step failed. Check `pg_namespace`,
   `public.user_tenant_mapping`, and the control plane `tenant` table.
8. **Search indices are not cleaned up.** In multi-tenant deployments all tenants share indices
   and are separated by a `tenant_id` field, so dropping a schema leaves that tenant's chunks
   behind. They can be swept later by selecting on `tenant_id` - keep `cleaned_tenants.csv`.
9. **The database writer is the real limit. Do not tune for throughput.**
   Dropping a tenant schema deletes on the order of 500 relations, so cleanup is a sustained
   burst of catalog writes against the cluster writer. On a live cluster this is the constraint
   that matters, well before pod CPU is.

   Measured on a real cleanup, and the reason this note exists:

   | rate | writer `DiskQueueDepth` | failures |
   |---|---|---|
   | ~34 tenants/min | low, occasional spikes | 0 in 500 tenants |
   | ~67 tenants/min | **50-64 sustained, tripped a >25 alarm** | 39 (`TLS handshake timeout`, `EOF`, failed execs) |

   The faster run paged an on-call engineer and started failing on infrastructure timeouts.
   `WriteLatency` stayed healthy throughout (2-5 ms), so `DiskQueueDepth` is the signal to watch -
   by the time latency moves you have gone much too far. **Watch it while running and back off if
   it approaches the alarm threshold. Prefer off-peak hours.** Roughly 30 tenants/min is a
   reasonable ceiling; there is no prize for finishing sooner.

10. **`--data-plane-pod` / `--control-plane-pod` are for spreading load, not for going faster.**
    Every operation is a `kubectl exec` against the one pod a run picked. Two runs without pinning
    usually land on the *same* pod - selection is random over a small set - saturating one live
    worker (~2 cores) while its replica idles. Pinning distinct pods per run fixes that
    distribution problem:

    ```bash
    # terminal 1
    ... --csv batch_a.csv --concurrency 8 \
        --data-plane-pod <worker-pod-1> --control-plane-pod <control-pod-1>
    # terminal 2
    ... --csv batch_b.csv --concurrency 8 \
        --data-plane-pod <worker-pod-2> --control-plane-pod <control-pod-2>
    ```

    Use this to keep any single worker from being pinned, and keep the *combined* rate under the
    ceiling in note 9. Running both at full tilt is what produced the failure row above.

## Files Generated

- `tenant_data_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - Raw per-tenant data. **Contains real user chat message
  text** (`last_query_text`); keep it out of the repo and off shared storage.
- `gated_tenants_inactive_<N>d_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` - List of tenants with no chat or Craft
  activity for N days. N is the `--inactive-days` value, 60 by default.
- `cleaned_tenants.csv` - Successfully cleaned tenants with timestamps. Appended across runs, and
  the only record of what was deleted - needed for any later search-index sweep.

## Safety First

The scripts include multiple safety checks:
- ✅ Verifies tenant status before any operation
- ✅ Checks documents are deleted before dropping schemas
- ✅ Prompts for confirmation on dangerous operations (unless `--force`)
- ✅ Records all successful operations in real-time
