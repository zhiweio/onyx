"""Auto-discovering coverage harness for source operations.

For every registered gateway, every (operation, variant) unit must be exercised,
per capability tag, by a capability check of that capability -- unless the
operation carries an ``untested`` reason. A per-connector session that registers
a gateway is picked up here automatically; it cannot forget to wire the test.
