# stop it relaying (CONNECT-tunneling) to internal services (databases, caches, search,
# metadata endpoints) — that destination is invisible at the sandbox's own egress (it sees
# "TCP to proxy:8080"). Deny any forwarded destination that is, or resolves to, an
# internal address; allow the one legitimate internal exception (the api-server) plus
# the public internet. Keying off "not globally routable" — not a hostname allow-list —
# catches internal services we never enumerated. The proxy's OWN cred-resolution DB
# client connects directly (not through the mitmproxy listener), so it is unaffected here.


# The single allowed internal destination: the api-server the sandbox calls via the
# proxy (PAT-injected). Matched by host AND port so it works even when it's an
