"""Sandbox readiness state machine: durable reservation, external
reconciliation, and finalization that only the newest attempt can perform.
Shared between the interactive create/restore flows and headless callers
(``ensure_sandbox_running``).

Every provisioning attempt gets a fresh number (``provisioning_attempt_number``),
and every status write is conditional on the row still holding that number —
so a superseded attempt's writes are no-ops, no matter when they land.

The lifecycle is split into three parts so no database transaction ever spans
external I/O:

1. **Reserve** (short transaction): lock the user row, commit the sandbox
   identity in ``PROVISIONING`` under a new attempt number, and commit the
   Craft PAT. Once committed, the proxy can resolve the pod's owner and
   credentials from any connection — a bootstrapping pod's egress works
   before the sandbox is ``RUNNING``.
2. **Reconcile** (no transaction): create/reuse the pod and its resources
   idempotently, push sandbox-level managed content.
3. **Finalize** (short transaction): record ``RUNNING`` or ``FAILED``, but
   only if this is still the newest attempt.
