"""Craft timeout registry.

Every Craft time constant is one of four things:

1. a **root** — a policy number a human chooses,
2. a **derivation** — arithmetic over a root, encoded here so tuning the root
   moves every dependent value with it,
3. the **fixed kit** — genuinely independent short timeouts in a small
   taxonomy (connect / RPC / bulk transfer / mutex lease), or
4. a **cadence** — poll and retry intervals.

Correctness never depends on any of these: a sandbox status write only
applies while the row still holds the writer's attempt number
(``provisioning_attempt_number``), and a turn write only applies for the owning
``runner_id``. Timeouts here only detect failure, bound budgets, or pace
polling.

Residence rule: a constant lives here only if it is used by multiple files,
is a derivation (or feeds one), or belongs to the shared client-I/O taxonomy.
A single-file, free-standing constant is defined at its point of use.
Env-tunable values (anything with its own ``os.environ`` read) live in
``configs.py`` even when their default is derived (e.g.
``OPENCODE_PROMPT_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``); pure non-tunable derivations
over those roots live here (e.g. ``RUNNER_STALE_AFTER_SECONDS``).

Ordering invariants (asserted by
``tests/unit/onyx/server/features/craft/test_timeout_registry.py``):

    cadences < probes/connect < mutex leases < PROVISION_DEADLINE
      < ATTEMPT_DEADLINE (== observer staleness threshold)
      < QUEUE_RESIDENCY < INTERACTIVE_TURN_HARD_CAP < ACTIVE_TURN_TTL
      < REQUEST_ID_TTL
    soft budget == TURN_SOFT_BUDGET_FRACTION x hard cap, per origin
      (the remainder is the wrap-up window)
    RUNNER_STALE_AFTER == 6 x SSE_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL
    OPENCODE_PROMPT_INACTIVITY > SANDBOX_APPROVAL_WAIT (configs.py)
    SANDBOX_HEARTBEAT_REFRESH << SANDBOX_IDLE_TIMEOUT (configs.py)

The client-I/O taxonomy (connect / RPC / bulk) is orthogonal to the ordering
chain — a bulk transfer legitimately outlasts a provision deadline.
