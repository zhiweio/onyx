"""Registry of flow tags applied to LLM-related generation spans.

Each value identifies the *operation* a span represents — e.g.
``contextual_rag_chunk_context`` or ``image_generation``. The provider, model,
and deployment are captured separately on the span's ``model_config``, so the
flow tag should describe **what the call does**, not **who serves it**.

A single source of truth here lets dashboards group/filter without typo drift,
and makes it possible to enforce instrumentation coverage by searching for
``LLMFlow.UNTAGGED_*`` (the sentinel used by the auto-wrap fallback).
