"""DB accessors for the latest-only credential capability reports.

One row per (credential, connector-scope): ``connector_id`` NULL is the
config-less credential-time report, non-NULL is one per attached connector.
Writers upsert against the scope's partial unique index, so concurrent writers
resolve to one row instead of racing an insert.

Two writer classes share these rows, with fixed precedence: granular named-check
runs write through ``upsert_completed_capability_report`` and replace whatever
is stored (latest-only truth); the coarse blocking-validation recorder writes
through the ``unless_granular`` variant and never replaces a granular report or
disturbs a run in flight. ``mark_capability_report_running`` and
``mark_stale_capability_runs_failed`` belong to the check-runner lifecycle: the
mark claims the row for a fresh run attempt (``run_id``) while the last
completed report stays readable, and the sweep retires marks that outlived their
run ceiling to FAILED_TO_RUN. The attempt's terminal writes are fenced on
``run_id``, so a superseded attempt can never mislabel its successor's row; the
sweep preserves ``run_id`` when retiring, so the same attempt's late completion
still lands (the self-heal for a run that was merely slow).
