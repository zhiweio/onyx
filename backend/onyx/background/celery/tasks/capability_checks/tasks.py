"""Celery tasks for the granular capability check runs.

The run task is enqueued by the capability-check trigger endpoint after it marks
the scope's row RUNNING, and writes through the unconditional upsert: a granular
run is the freshest truth and replaces whatever is stored (see the accessors'
writer model). A run that fails gracefully records FAILED_TO_RUN itself; only
hard kills and expired tasks leave their row RUNNING for the beat sweep to
retire once the mark outlives its source's run ceiling.
