# Onyx Developer Script

[![Deploy Status](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx/actions/workflows/release-devtools.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx/actions/workflows/release-devtools.yml)
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/onyx-devtools.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/onyx-devtools/)

`ods` is [onyx.app](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx)'s devtools utility script.
It is packaged as a python [wheel](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/package-formats/) and available from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/onyx-devtools/).

## Installation

A stable version of `ods` is provided in the default [python venv](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#backend-python-requirements)
which is synced automatically if you have [pre-commit](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#formatting-and-linting)
hooks installed.

While inside the Onyx repository, activate the root project's venv,

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Prerequisites

Some commands require external tools to be installed and configured:

- **Docker** - Required for `compose`, `logs`, and `pull` commands
  - Install from [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

- **uv** - Required for `backend` commands
  - Install from [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

- **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) - Required for `run-ci`, `cherry-pick`, and `trace` commands

  - Install from [aws.amazon.com/cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
  - Authenticate with `aws sso login` or `aws configure`

### Autocomplete

`ods` provides autocomplete for `bash`, `fish`, `powershell` and `zsh` shells.

For more information, see `ods completion <shell> --help` for your respective `<shell>`.

#### zsh

_Linux_

```shell
ods completion zsh | sudo tee "${fpath[1]}/_ods" > /dev/null
```

_macOS_

```shell
ods completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_ods
```

#### bash

```shell
ods completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/ods > /dev/null
```

_Note: bash completion requires the [bash-completion](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion/) package be installed._

## Commands

### `compose` - Launch Docker Containers

Launch Onyx docker containers using docker compose.

```shell
ods compose [profile]
```

**Profiles:**

- `dev` - Use dev configuration (exposes service ports for development)
- `multitenant` - Use multitenant configuration

**Flags:**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--down` | `false` | Stop running containers instead of starting them |
| `--wait` | `true` | Wait for services to be healthy before returning |
| `--force-recreate` | `false` | Force recreate containers even if unchanged |
| `--tag` | | Set the `IMAGE_TAG` for docker compose (e.g. `edge`, `v2.10.4`) |

**Examples:**

```shell
# Start containers with default configuration
ods compose

# Start containers with dev configuration
ods compose dev

# Start containers with multitenant configuration
ods compose multitenant

# Stop running containers
ods compose --down
ods compose dev --down

# Start without waiting for services to be healthy
ods compose --wait=false

# Force recreate containers
ods compose --force-recreate

# Use a specific image tag
ods compose --tag edge
```

### `logs` - View Docker Container Logs

View logs from running Onyx docker containers. Service names are available as
arguments to filter output, with tab-completion support.

```shell
ods logs [service...]
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--follow` | `true` | Follow log output |
| `--tail` | | Number of lines to show from the end of the logs |

**Examples:**

```shell
# View logs from all services (follow mode)
ods logs

# View logs for a specific service
ods logs api_server

# View logs for multiple services
ods logs api_server background

# View last 100 lines and follow
ods logs --tail 100 api_server

# View logs without following
ods logs --follow=false
```

### `pull` - Pull Docker Images

Pull the latest images for Onyx docker containers.

```shell
ods pull
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--tag` | | Set the `IMAGE_TAG` for docker compose (e.g. `edge`, `v2.10.4`) |

**Examples:**

```shell
# Pull images
ods pull

# Pull images with a specific tag
ods pull --tag edge
```

### `backend` - Run Backend Services

Run backend services (API server, model server) with environment loaded from
`.vscode/.env`. On first run, copies `.vscode/env_template.txt` to `.vscode/.env`
if the `.env` file does not already exist.

Enterprise Edition features are enabled by default with license enforcement
disabled, matching the `compose` command behavior.

```shell
ods backend <subcommand>
```

**Subcommands:**

- `api` - Start the FastAPI backend server (`uvicorn onyx.main:app --reload`)
- `model_server` - Start the model server (`uvicorn model_server.main:app --reload`)

**Flags:**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--no-ee` | `false` | Disable Enterprise Edition features (enabled by default) |
| `--port` | `8080` (api) / `9000` (model_server) | Port to listen on |

Shell environment takes precedence over `.env` file values, so inline overrides
work as expected (e.g. `S3_ENDPOINT_URL=foo ods backend api`).

**Examples:**

```shell
# Start the API server
ods backend api

# Start the API server on a custom port
ods backend api --port 9090

# Start without Enterprise Edition
ods backend api --no-ee

# Start the model server
ods backend model_server

# Start the model server on a custom port
ods backend model_server --port 9001
```

### `web` - Run Frontend Scripts

Run bun scripts from `web/package.json` without manually changing directories.

```shell
ods web <script> [args...]
```

Script names are available via shell completion (for supported shells via
`ods completion`), and are read from `web/package.json`.

**Examples:**

```shell
# Start the Next.js dev server
ods web dev

# Run web lint task
ods web lint

# Forward extra args to the script
ods web test --watch
```

### `test` - Run Tests

Run the repo's test suites without changing directories or remembering which
suite owns a file.

```shell
ods test <suite|path> [args...]
```

The first argument is a suite name or a path inside a suite. A path selects the
suite that covers it, so you can pass a file straight from your editor. All
later arguments go to the suite's test runner.

| Suite | Aliases | Directory | Runner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ods` | | `tools/ods` | `go test` |
| `cli` | | `cli` | `go test` |
| `terraform` | `tf` | `terraform-provider-onyx` | `go test` |

The Go suites run with `-race`, the same as `pr-golang-tests.yml`. A runner that
takes packages rather than files, such as `go test`, runs the package that holds
a file argument. `<file>::<TestName>` runs one test.

**Examples:**

```shell
# Run a whole module
ods test ods

# Run one package, one file's package, or one test
ods test tools/ods/internal/testsuite
ods test tools/ods/internal/testsuite/testsuite_test.go
ods test tools/ods/internal/testsuite/testsuite_test.go::TestResolveGoTargets

# Forward arguments to go test
ods test cli -run TestChat -v
```

### `coverage` - Measure Go Coverage Against a Baseline

Measure Go statement coverage per package and hold it against a committed
baseline, so coverage can go up but not down.

```shell
ods coverage <suite|module-dir> [flags]
```

The baseline is a `.coverage-baseline.yaml` at the module root recording each
package's floor. `--check` fails when a package drops below its floor, which is
what `pr-golang-tests.yml` runs on every PR. After adding tests, `--update`
raises the floors.

Coverage is measured per package with `go test -coverprofile`, so a package's
number counts only its own tests. That is a number the package's owner can act
on; a cross-package `-coverpkg` total would credit a package for statements its
own tests never assert on.

The suites are the same Go modules `ods test` knows: `ods`, `cli`, and
`terraform`. A module directory such as `tools/ods` is accepted in place of a
suite name, which is what CI passes.

**Flags:**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--check` | `false` | Fail when a package drops below its baseline floor |
| `--update` | `false` | Rewrite the baseline from this run |
| `--profile` | | Keep the coverage profile at this path (for `go tool cover`) |
| `--html` | | Render the profile as a browsable page at this path |
| `--markdown` | | Write the changed packages as a markdown table at this path, for a PR comment |
| `--tolerance` | `0.1` | Percentage points a package may drop below its floor without failing |

**Examples:**

```shell
# Report where each package stands
ods coverage ods

# Fail on a regression (what CI runs)
ods coverage ods --check

# Record today's numbers as the new floors
ods coverage ods --update

# Keep the profile and browse the uncovered lines
ods coverage ods --profile /tmp/cover.out
go tool cover -html=/tmp/cover.out
```

#### Raising the baseline

The gate never fails on an improvement, so a baseline goes stale as tests are
added. `ods coverage ods` reports how many packages have risen; commit the gain
with `--update` so the new level becomes the floor.

`pr-golang-tests.yml` runs `ods coverage <module> --check` for every Go module.
Without a baseline the tests still run and the report prints, but nothing is
gated. A module opts into the gate by committing a baseline, so `cli` and
`terraform-provider-onyx` join by running `ods coverage <suite> --update` once.

In CI, each module's `--markdown` report goes to the job summary, and its
`--html` page is uploaded as an artifact and published to the reports bucket.
One PR comment, updated in place, lists the modules with a baseline where a
package moved, each with a link to its page.

Floors are rounded down to one decimal, and a package may sit `--tolerance`
below its floor without failing. That absorbs the jitter from suites that depend
on ports or timing; a real regression is far larger.

The package floors are the gate. The module total is reported with its delta
but never fails the check: a package added without tests, or a well-covered
package deleted, moves the total without any package regressing.

### `dev` - Devcontainer Management

Manage the Onyx devcontainer. Also available as `ods dc`.

Requires the [devcontainer CLI](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli) (`bun install -g @devcontainers/cli`).

```shell
ods dev <subcommand>
```

**Subcommands:**

- `up` - Start the devcontainer (pulls the image if needed)
- `into` - Open a zsh shell inside the running devcontainer
- `exec` - Run an arbitrary command inside the devcontainer
- `restart` - Remove and recreate the devcontainer
- `rebuild` - Pull the latest published image and recreate
- `stop` - Stop the running devcontainer

The devcontainer image is published to `onyxdotapp/onyx-devcontainer` and
referenced by tag in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` — no local build needed.

**Examples:**

```shell
# Start the devcontainer
ods dev up

# Open a shell
ods dev into

# Run a command
ods dev exec -- bun test

# Restart the container
ods dev restart

# Pull latest image and recreate
ods dev rebuild

# Stop the container
ods dev stop

# Same commands work with the dc alias
ods dc up
ods dc into
```

### `db` - Database Administration

Manage PostgreSQL database dumps, restores, and migrations.

```shell
ods db <subcommand>
```

**Subcommands:**

- `dump` - Create a database dump
- `restore` - Restore from a dump
- `upgrade`/`downgrade` - Run database migrations
- `drop` - Drop a database

Run `ods db --help` for detailed usage.

### `openapi` - OpenAPI Schema Generation

Generate OpenAPI schemas and client code.

```shell
ods openapi all
```

### `check-lazy-imports` - Verify Lazy Import Compliance

Check that specified modules are only lazily imported (used for keeping backend startup fast).

```shell
ods check-lazy-imports
```

### `check-getattr` - Forbids the getattr Builtin

Checks that backend Python code does not reference the `getattr` builtin, which
hides attribute access from the type checker. Genuinely dynamic lookups are
suppressed inline with `# ods: ignore[getattr]` plus a brief justification.
String literal contents and comments never match; replacement fields inside
f-strings are scanned as code.

```shell
ods check-getattr [paths...]
```

`--annotate` appends the ignore marker to every violating line (baseline maintenance).

### `fmt` - Format Sources

Also available as `ods format`.

#### `fmt tf` - Format Terraform

Rewrite Terraform files into the canonical HCL style. Also available as
`ods fmt terraform`.

```shell
ods fmt tf [paths...]
```

This applies the same formatter as `terraform fmt`, so the output matches
terraform byte for byte, but no terraform binary is needed. A file that does not
parse is reported and left alone.

Files and directories may be given to limit the run. With no arguments, the
whole repository is scanned. Vendored trees (`.terraform`, `node_modules`,
`.venv`) are always skipped.

**Flags:**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--check` | `false` | Report unformatted files without rewriting them |

**Examples:**

```shell
# Format every .tf file in the repository
ods fmt tf

# Format one subtree
ods fmt tf deployment/terraform

# Report unformatted files, change nothing
ods fmt tf --check
```

The command exits non-zero when a file was rewritten or failed to parse, which
is how the `terraform-fmt` pre-commit hook gates a commit.

### `lint` - Run Linters

#### `lint tf` - Check Published Terraform

Check published Terraform modules for values that must stay internal. Also
available as `ods lint terraform`.

```shell
ods lint tf [paths...]
```

The modules under `deployment/terraform` are published, but they stay in sync
with the infrastructure Onyx runs. That makes it easy to carry an internal value
across by accident -- an office IP in a variable default is the case this check
was written for.

The check looks for objective patterns only:

| Rule | Fails on |
|------|----------|
| `access_key` | AWS access key ids (`AKIA…`, `ASIA…`) |
| `email` | Email addresses |
| `cidr` | Routable IPv4 CIDRs; private and reserved ranges pass |
| `account_id` | 12-digit values that look like AWS account ids |

It cannot screen for customer names, because listing them here would leak them;
that stays a review step.

Add a trailing `# public-safe: ok` comment to accept a specific line.

Files and directories may be given to limit the check. With no arguments,
`deployment/terraform` is scanned.

**Examples:**

```shell
# Check all published modules
ods lint tf

# Check one subtree
ods lint tf deployment/terraform/modules/aws

# Check a single file
ods lint tf deployment/terraform/modules/aws/vpc/main.tf
```

### `audit` - Audit Dependencies for Vulnerabilities

> **Install the `audit` extra first.** The scanner is about 50 MB, most of the
> download, so it ships as a separate `onyx-devtools-audit` wheel that provides
> the `ods-audit` binary. `ods audit` forwards to it and prints an install hint
> when it is missing.
>
> ```shell
> # Install alongside ods
> uv tool install 'onyx-devtools[audit]'
>
> # Or run it without installing (how CI runs the gate)
> uv run --with 'onyx-devtools[audit]' ods audit
> ```
>
> `ods-audit` takes the same arguments, so `ods audit --python` and
> `ods-audit --python` are the same command.

Scan the JavaScript (`bun.lock`) and Python (`uv.lock`) lockfiles via
[osv-scanner](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner) (vendored as a library, no
external binary required) and open GitHub Dependabot security alerts for known
vulnerabilities. With no selector flags, all sources are audited.

Accepted advisories are suppressed via an allowlist fetched from S3 at runtime
(`s3://onyx-internal-tools/audit/ignores.json` by default), so a release can be
unblocked without a code change. The command exits non-zero when an unignored
finding at or above `--fail-on` (default `critical`) remains, which is how it
gates deploys.

```shell
ods audit [--web] [--python] [--dependabot] [--format text[,json][,sarif]] [--fail-on critical|high|moderate|low] [--ignore-url s3://...]
```

`--format` takes a comma-separated list. The machine-readable formats (`json`,
`sarif`) are written to **stdout**, while the human-readable text report is
written to **stderr** when combined with one of them. This lets a single run
produce a SARIF file for upload *and* a readable report in the log: `ods audit
--format=sarif,text > audit.sarif` sends SARIF to the file and the report (plus,
when the gate fails, a runbook explaining how to resolve or suppress each
finding) to the terminal. A lone format always goes to stdout, so
`--format=sarif > audit.sarif` is unchanged. At most one machine-readable format
may be requested.

**Examples:**

```shell
# Audit everything; fail on unignored criticals
ods audit

# Only the Python lockfile
ods audit --python

# Emit a SARIF report (used by the nightly GitHub code-scanning job)
ods audit --python --format=sarif > audit.sarif

# SARIF to a file for upload, readable report to the log (used by CI gates)
ods audit --format=sarif,text > audit.sarif
```

#### Managing the allowlist

Suppress a reviewed-and-accepted advisory so it stops blocking the gate:

```shell
# Interactive editor (add/edit/delete rows, then upload after a confirmation)
ods audit ignore

# Non-interactive add of a single suppression (a --reason is required)
ods audit ignore add GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx --ecosystem npm \
  --reason "not reachable in our usage" --expires 2026-09-01
```

`ods audit ignore add` stamps `added_by` from your git email, shows a diff, and
uploads the updated allowlist to S3 after a confirmation prompt (`--yes` skips
it). Suppress only advisories you've assessed — the allowlist gates every deploy.

The allowlist is a JSON document of the form:

```json
{
  "ignores": [
    {
      "id": "GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx",
      "ecosystem": "npm",
      "reason": "not reachable in our usage",
      "added_by": "you@onyx.app",
      "expires": "2026-09-01"
    }
  ]
}
```

`id` matches a finding's id or any of its aliases (case-insensitive); `ecosystem`
and `expires` are optional (an expired entry stops suppressing).

### `run-ci` - Run CI on Fork PRs

Pull requests from forks don't automatically trigger GitHub Actions for security reasons.
This command creates a branch and PR in the main repository to run CI on a fork's code.

```shell
ods run-ci <pr-number>
```

**Example:**

```shell
# Run CI for PR #7353 from a fork
ods run-ci 7353
```

### `cherry-pick` - Backport Commits to Release Branches

Cherry-pick one or more commits to release branches and automatically create PRs.
Cherry-pick PRs created by this command are labeled `cherry-pick 🍒`.

```shell
ods cherry-pick <commit-sha> [<commit-sha>...] [--release <version>]
```

**Examples:**

```shell
# Cherry-pick a single commit (auto-detects release version)
ods cherry-pick abc123

# Cherry-pick to a specific release
ods cherry-pick abc123 --release 2.5

# Cherry-pick to multiple releases
ods cherry-pick abc123 --release 2.5 --release 2.6

# Cherry-pick multiple commits
ods cherry-pick abc123 def456 ghi789 --release 2.5
```

### `screenshot-diff` - Visual Regression Testing

Compare Playwright screenshots against baselines and generate visual diff reports.
Baselines are stored per-project and per-revision in S3:

```
s3://<bucket>/baselines/<project>/<rev>/
```

This allows storing baselines for `main`, release branches (`release/2.5`), and
version tags (`v2.0.0`) side-by-side. Revisions containing `/` are sanitised to
`-` in the S3 path (e.g. `release/2.5` → `release-2.5`).

```shell
ods screenshot-diff <subcommand>
```

**Subcommands:**

- `compare` - Compare screenshots against baselines and generate a diff report
- `upload-baselines` - Upload screenshots to S3 as new baselines

The `--project` flag provides sensible defaults so you don't need to specify every path.
When set, the following defaults are applied:

| Flag | Default |
|------|---------|
| `--baseline` | `s3://onyx-playwright-artifacts/baselines/<project>/<rev>/` |
| `--current` | `web/output/screenshots/` |
| `--output` | `web/output/screenshot-diff/<project>/index.html` |
| `--rev` | `main` |

The S3 bucket defaults to `onyx-playwright-artifacts` and can be overridden with the
`PLAYWRIGHT_S3_BUCKET` environment variable.

**`compare` Flags:**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--project` | | Project name (e.g. `admin`); sets sensible defaults |
| `--rev` | `main` | Revision baseline to compare against |
| `--from-rev` | | Source (older) revision for cross-revision comparison |
| `--to-rev` | | Target (newer) revision for cross-revision comparison |
| `--baseline` | | Baseline directory or S3 URL (`s3://...`) |
| `--current` | | Current screenshots directory or S3 URL (`s3://...`) |
| `--output` | `screenshot-diff/index.html` | Output path for the HTML report |
| `--threshold` | `0.2` | Per-channel pixel difference threshold (0.0–1.0) |
| `--max-diff-ratio` | `0.01` | Max diff pixel ratio before marking as changed |

**`upload-baselines` Flags:**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--project` | | Project name (e.g. `admin`); sets sensible defaults |
| `--rev` | `main` | Revision to store the baseline under |
| `--dir` | | Local directory containing screenshots to upload |
| `--dest` | | S3 destination URL (`s3://...`) |
| `--delete` | `false` | Delete S3 files not present locally |

**Examples:**

```shell
# Compare local screenshots against the main baseline (default)
ods screenshot-diff compare --project admin

# Compare against a release branch baseline
ods screenshot-diff compare --project admin --rev release/2.5

# Compare two revisions directly (both sides fetched from S3)
ods screenshot-diff compare --project admin --from-rev v1.0.0 --to-rev v2.0.0

# Compare with explicit paths
ods screenshot-diff compare \
  --baseline ./baselines \
  --current ./web/output/screenshots/ \
  --output ./report/index.html

# Upload baselines for main (default)
ods screenshot-diff upload-baselines --project admin

# Upload baselines for a release branch
ods screenshot-diff upload-baselines --project admin --rev release/2.5

# Upload baselines for a version tag
ods screenshot-diff upload-baselines --project admin --rev v2.0.0

# Upload with delete (remove old baselines not in current set)
ods screenshot-diff upload-baselines --project admin --delete
```

The `compare` subcommand writes a `summary.json` alongside the report with aggregate
counts (changed, added, removed, unchanged). The HTML report is only generated when
visual differences are detected.

### `trace` - View Playwright Traces from CI

Download Playwright trace artifacts from a GitHub Actions run and open them
with `playwright show-trace`. Traces are only generated for failing tests
(`retain-on-failure`).

```shell
ods trace [run-id-or-url]
```

The run can be specified as a numeric run ID, a full GitHub Actions URL, or
omitted to find the latest Playwright run for the current branch.

**Flags:**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--branch`, `-b` | | Find latest run for this branch |
| `--pr` | | Find latest run for this PR number |
| `--project`, `-p` | | Filter to a specific project (`admin`, `exclusive`, `lite`) |
| `--list`, `-l` | `false` | List available traces without opening |
| `--no-open` | `false` | Download traces but don't open them |

When multiple traces are found, an interactive picker lets you select which
traces to open. Use arrow keys or `j`/`k` to navigate, `space` to toggle,
`a` to select all, `n` to deselect all, and `enter` to open. Falls back to a
plain-text prompt when no TTY is available.

Downloaded artifacts are cached in `/tmp/ods-traces/<run-id>/` so repeated
invocations for the same run are instant.

**Examples:**

```shell
# Latest run for the current branch
ods trace

# Specific run ID
ods trace 12345678

# Full GitHub Actions URL
ods trace https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx/actions/runs/12345678

# Latest run for a PR
ods trace --pr 9500

# Latest run for a specific branch
ods trace --branch main

# Only download admin project traces
ods trace --project admin

# List traces without opening
ods trace --list
```

### Testing Changes Locally (Dry Run)

Both `run-ci` and `cherry-pick` support `--dry-run` to test without making remote changes:

```shell
# See what would happen without pushing
ods run-ci 7353 --dry-run
ods cherry-pick abc123 --release 2.5 --dry-run
```

## Upgrading

To upgrade the stable version, upgrade it as you would any other [requirement](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx/tree/main/backend/requirements#readme).

## Building from source

Generally, `go build .` or `go install .` are sufficient.

`go build .` will output a `tools/ods/ods` binary which you can call normally,

```shell
./ods --version
```

while `go install .` will output to your [GOPATH](https://go.dev/wiki/SettingGOPATH) (defaults `~/go/bin/ods`),

```shell
~/go/bin/ods --version
```

_Typically, `GOPATH` is added to your shell's `PATH`, but this may be confused easily during development
with the pip version of `ods` installed in the Onyx venv._

To build the wheel,

```shell
uv build --wheel
```

To build and install the wheel,

```shell
uv pip install .
```

## Deploy

Releases are deployed automatically when git tags prefaced with `ods/` are pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx/tags).

The [release-tag](https://pypi.org/project/release-tag/) package can be used to calculate and push the next tag automatically,

```shell
tag --prefix ods
```
