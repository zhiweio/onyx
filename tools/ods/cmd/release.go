// NewReleaseCommand creates the parent `ods release` command. Subcommands hang

// packages; --check validates an existing release tag instead.

		Long: `Cut releases of Onyx-published packages.

With --check, no tag is cut. Instead the command validates an existing release
tag:

  - A cloud tag (vX.Y.Z-cloud.N) must be the tag "ods deploy cloud" would
    have computed: its commit is on origin/main, its base matches the release
    branches, and its counter is one past the previous counter for that base.
  - A stable tag (vX.Y.Z) must sit on origin/release/vX.Y, its patch must be
    one past the highest existing vX.Y.* patch, and its predecessor must be an
    ancestor of the tagged commit.
  - A beta tag (vX.Y.Z-beta.N) must sit on origin/release/vX.Y, its base must
    not have shipped as a stable tag yet, its counter must be one past the
    previous counter for that base, and its predecessor must be an ancestor of
    the tagged commit.

deployment.yml runs this against pushed release tags before building. --ref
may name the tag directly; otherwise the single release tag pointing at --ref
(default HEAD) is checked.

Example usage:

    $ ods release --check
    $ ods release --check --ref v4.7.0-cloud.3
    $ ods release --check --ref v4.6.2
    $ ods release --check --ref v4.7.0-beta.1`,

				// A lone --ref would otherwise print help and exit 0, hiding
				// a mistyped check invocation from CI.
				if cmd.Flags().Changed("ref") {
					return fmt.Errorf("--ref requires --check")
				}
				return cmd.Help()
			}
			return release.CheckTag(ref)
		},
	}
